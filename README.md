# python_resources

This repo includes:
- list of Python resources I found useful
- my personal Python notes 

This is by no means a full list of Python resources and will certainly be opinionated and miss some good ones. **Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests.**
There is an entry level Python presentation I shared, you can found the video [here](http://www.bittiger.io/videos/ZHyZrrv7KHKxNkgvZ/2EkqDyjCYc5x8WPfW) and the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o9cuotNB9qWfOJiG94qDlwZNN1D3kD2SuGgHX6b2_Gg/edit?usp=sharing).


## Learning Resources

### New programmers
For people who have never programmed, an online interactive course like [code cademy (python 2)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) is highly recommended. Other online courses includes:
- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
- *Python Wiki*'s Beginner Guide for [non-programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) also includes a list of interactive courses and other useful resources

### (Online) Books
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](docs.python-guide.org) is a great place to get started especially for experienced programmers
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - although personally not my favourite at all,  many people do recommend it
- [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/) is a in-depth book for experienced progammers. Do note that it is about Python 2 and is a bit dated.
- [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) is a brilliant book for anyone who wants to understand Python 3 and its difference from Python 2. 
- [Effective Python](http://www.effectivepython.com/) - you would have to pay for this one, but this is one of the best books I found about how to write good Python code. Reading this book helps you avoid so many pitfalls. I strongly recommend it, and it includes both Python 2 and 3 examples
- [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/) includes huge amount of Python resources for programmers who wants to build Python softwares

### Styling Guides
In Python, styling guides are **NOT** just about styles. By adopting [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), you are essentially chosing a more **effecient**, **bug-free**, and readable way to write your code. **Adopting PEP8 early** allows you to avoid 90% of pitfalls. 

- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is a famous short paragraph about the spirit of Python. 
- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is an interesting read.
